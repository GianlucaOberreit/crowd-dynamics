## Social Force model
All files for the social force model should be run from within the `social_force` directory.

All paths in this section are assumed to be prepended by `social_force/`
Ready to run simulations files are available for (among others)
 - bidirectional pedestrian motion in a hallway (`situation_tests/hallway.py`)
 - bidirectional flow through a hallway with a bottleneck (`situation_tests/doorway`)
 - intersection of two pedestrians at an angle (`situation_tests/striping.py`)
 - unidirectional flow of pedestrians around a corner (`situation_tests/corner.py`)

Videos of these simulations have been saved in the `videos` directory under self-explanatory names.
The images from the social force section of the report are saved in `images`
